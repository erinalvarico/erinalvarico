## 👋 Hi, I'm Erin Alvarico!
I am a Management Consultant in Data & AI at Accenture. With a background in high-tech industries like GenAI and the Metaverse, I bring expertise in team and project management, game development, and strategy. I'm a versatile developer who thrives in various roles—whether it’s concept design, level design, interaction engineering, or production. My unique blend of software development and consulting experience allows me to seamlessly take on various development roles and drive innovation across teams.

🛠️ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 <br>
Outside of my tech career, I’m a content creator and indie game developer. I founded Kuneho Studios, my indie game start-up, to bring my passion for game development to life by highlighting online personalities and brand identities through interactive media. Through my social media presence, I share my love for indie games with extensive playthroughs and reviews, alongside my hobbies in tech building, art, and illustration. In both of these endeavors, I aim to cultivate a community driven by my passion and ambition!

🎯 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹𝘀 <br>
I aspire to grow Kuneho Studios into a thriving game development company, continue my involvement in charity fundraising, and use my social media presence to inspire others to chase their dreams. Through this journey, I aim to refine my skills in game development, leadership, and management. Giving back to the communities that have supported me in getting this far is my way of helping build the next generation of ambitious game-changers.

🤝 𝗟𝗲𝘁'𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁! <br>
Feel free to reach out if you want to get to know each other! I'm always excited to make new acquaintances, so don't hesitate to send a message my way. After all, we can support each other in our goals by working together!
